In this projext, I have utilized ML algorithms in Python such as support vector machine, stochastic gradient descent,
and logistic regression to predict the attendance at a home teamâ€™s game for professional baseball (MLB) played in season 2016.
Compared the accuracy of different models, performed L1 and L2 regularizations to reduce overfitting and obtained the best performing
model with an accuracy of 82%
